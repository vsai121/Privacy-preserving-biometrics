algorithm gives the smallest of the two integers a and b by comparing them bit by bit

minimum(a,b):
1. set cmp = 1
2. for each bit ai of a and bi of b:
    2.1. if ai != bi
        2.1.1. cmp = ai
    2.2. else
        2.2.1. cmp = cmp
3. if cmp = 0       //i.e. the last time an inequality occurred, ai was 0
    3.1. return a
4. else             //i.e. the last time an inequality occurred, ai was 1
    4.1 return b
